	<h2>All About Aminata ☺️ </h2>

	<p>My name is Aminata, I'm a senior in high school who's about to graduate early. I have loads of dreams and passions that i want to pursue like becoming a surgeon and being a bestselling author. All of these jobs require hard work and drive which I think I can do, even if it requires me having to be in school longer than I have to. I also love to write on my free time and find time to work so that I can save enough money before I go to college. I have a lot of dreams but I know it won't be easy to grasp.</p>

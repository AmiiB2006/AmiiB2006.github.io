<h1> The Vampire Diaries </h1>

<h2> The originals  </h2>

<p> Following a clue provided by Katherine that a plot is brewing against him, Klaus  travels to New Orleans, the city he and his family helped build. Klaus' investigation leads him to a reunion with his former protégé, Marcel  a vampire who has total control of the city's supernatural and human inhabitants. Determined to help his brother find redemption, Elijah goes in search of Klaus and soon learns that Hayley has also come to the French Quarter looking for clues to her family history, and has fallen into the hands of a powerful witch named Sophie , who reveals something that makes Klaus reconsider the situation and that can bring his family back together. Meanwhile, in Mystic Falls, Katherine reveals a surprising vulnerability to Rebekah and asks her to deliver a message to Elijah, while Damon and Stefan  continue their plan to return Elena's humanity by imprisoning her in the basement of the Salvatore house.

</p>

<h2> Original Sin </h2>

<p> Stefan is found and saved by Qetsiyah (Tessa in present time played by Janina Gavankar) who is later revealed that she is a powerful witch from Silas' past. Stefan asks her to tell him who she is and Tessa tells him the story of her and Silas when they first met in Ancient Greece two thousand years ago. Silas was in love with Amara (the progenitor of the Petrova doppelgängers) and he wanted them to live together forever. He pretended to be in love with Qetsiyah so she could make them an immortality spell which she does thinking that it would be for the two of them. Silas stole it and drank it with Amara, abandoning Qetsiyah the day of their wedding. Qetsiyah found out what happened, so she created the Cure, gave it to Amara and then killed her. She tried to force Silas to take it too but he refused, so Qetsiyah locked him in the tomb for 2000 years with the Cure hoping he would take it. Qetsiyah was watching him all these years from the Other Side (she admits that she created the Other Side too) but got frustrated when Silas was freed and the Hunters (who she sent) failed to kill him. She managed to escape from the Other Side when Bonnie (Kat Graham) dropped the veil and now she tries to kill Silas by herself, but she needs Stefan for her plan.</p>

<h2> Monster's ball </h2>

<p> Meanwhile, Elena attempts to deal with Bonnie's and morgan's death and why Professor Maxfield covered the reason she died. While she ponders how to get the information she needs, she sees someone at Megan's grave. She approaches the stranger and asks him his name and if he knew Megan, but the man seems reluctant to answer her questions. It is later revealed that the man's name is Aaron and Professor Wes is his guardian. Wes asks Aaron to stay away from Elena and then, on an encounter with Elena at the Whitmore Historical Ball, he tells her to leave college and go back to Mystic Falls with her friends as there are people at Whitmore who are watching her.
